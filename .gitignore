#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

.rspec
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/public/system
